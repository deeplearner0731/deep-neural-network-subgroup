# Deep Learning-Based Ranking Method for Subgroup and Predictive Biomarkers Identification

## Overview

**DeepRAB** is a deep learning-based framework designed for identifying subgroups and predictive biomarkers in precision medicine. 

## Features
- **DeepRAB Framework**: Implements the core DeepRAB model for identifying subgroups and predictive biomarkers.
- **Causal Forest Framework**: Integrates the Causal Forest (CF) model for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) as a comparison.
- **XGBoost with Modified Loss Function**: A customized version of XGBoost tailored for biomarker identification, incorporating an A-learning loss function.
- **Linear Regression Models**: Implements linear regression with both modified outcomes and modified covariates.

## Latest Update â€” July 2025
We refactored the DeepRAB codebase to eliminate reported bugs.

### Prerequisites
