# Causal Forest and Linear Regression Demo Code

Overview

This folder contains demo code for two baseline models: Causal Forest (CF) and Linear Regression models with modifications for outcomes and covariates. These methods are used for subgroup and predictive biomarker identification.

Implementations Included:
- **Causal Forest (CF)**: Implemented using the R package grf for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE).
- **Linear Regression with Modified Outcomes (LRMO)**: Specifically designed for continuous outcome simulations.
- **Linear Regression with Modified Covariates (LRMC)**: Not included in this demo.
Note:
The demo code currently includes the implementation of LRMO for continuous outcomes only. For other configurations, users may need to adapt the code accordingly.
