This folder contains the demo code for DeepRAB, a deep learning-based ranking method for identifying subgroups and predictive biomarkers.

The demo focuses on Simulation Scenario I for continuous outcomes, specifically for cases where the prognostic effect is set to 0 and the predictive effect is 0.1. Users are encouraged to modify the parameters and apply the method to other datasets with varying predictive and prognostic effects.

In addition to the A-learning loss used in the paper, we have also included an implementation of weight-learning loss in the provided code.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code on different datasets!
