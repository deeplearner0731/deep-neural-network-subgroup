This folder contains the demo code for deep learning-based ranking method for subgroup and predictive biomarkers identification (DeepRAB).
The demo code works for simulation data case I for contious outcomes in the case where pronogstis effect =0 and predictive effects=0.1, usrers feel free to tune the patameters on other dataset with different predictive and progostics effect. 
in addtion to paper with A-learning loss, we also include the weight-learning loss in the code.
